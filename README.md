My first project in the cyber filed
The mission: 
OPERATION ORDER
Operation Info Extractor is a straight-to-the-point mission with one clear
goal: "Gather System Info." This task involves creating a smart script to dig
into the system and pull out key details. You'll need to find out network info
like IP and MAC addresses, check how the system is running by looking at CPU
and memory use, and figure out which files and folders are the biggest. Your
mission is to do this neatly and efficiently, giving us a clear picture of what's
going on inside the system.
